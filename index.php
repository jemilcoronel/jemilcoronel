<p><h4><br>I am Jemil P. Coronel from Gutalac Zamboanga del Norte but now presently lived in Inayagan city of Naga Cebu.
I'm studying in CTU Naga Extension Canpus with the course of BSICT.
 
<br>When I was 13 years old my father died. We are six siblings;two sisters and 4 brothers,I am the oldest. After the<
death of father my uncle brought us here in Cebu. When we were in Cebu,I lived in my uncle's house and my one brother
too. My sisters lived in my grandma's house,they continued their study there. Our mother cannot send us to school,
provide food,and shelter, because she has a heart problem.<br>
<br>My uncle Timothy where I lived in there house said to me;"continue your study in Elementary I will provide you".
I continue to study in Elementary untill I gradute.After I graduted in Elementary my friends tempted me to use cigarettes,
and drink lechor. At that time my life was damage because of my worldly friends.My uncle stoped to send me to school
because of my wrong doings.Years go by I regret myself why I entered that kind of evil doing.There's a time that where
we about to captured by the law because of our deeds. My mother always advice me to stop my evildoings,beceuse many times
where we about to captured by the law,therefore I decided to stop my frailty. The fact that I stop my frailty because my 
mother has a heart problem. I force myself to stop all that evildoings,and eventully I did it.After that I continue to 
study in high school until I gradute.<br>
<br>Eventhough,we were poor we always pray to the Lord that He will gave us good health. And now I still studying in 
CTU-Naga Extension Campus. I have lot of learning from my past,therefore I move on and begin to face my future. I long to 
finish my study.And may the Lord bless me.</p><h4>
